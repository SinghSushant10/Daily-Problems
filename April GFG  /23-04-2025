#Unique Number II
Given an array arr[] containing 2*n + 2 positive numbers, out of which 2*n numbers exist in pairs whereas only two number occur exactly once and are distinct. Find the other two numbers. Return the answer in increasing order.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4]
Output: [3, 4] 
Explanation: 3 and 4 occur exactly once.
Input: arr[] = [2, 1, 3, 2]
Output: [1, 3]
Explanation: 1 and 3 occur exactly once.
Input: arr[] = [2, 1, 3, 3]
Output: [1, 2]
Explanation: 1 and 2 occur exactly once.
Constraints:
2 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 106 
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 5 * 106
arr.size() is even

class Solution {
    public int[] singleNum(int[] arr) {
        // Get the XOR of the two numbers we need to find
        int xorVal = 0;
        for (int i : arr) {
            xorVal ^= i;
        }

        // Get its last set bit
        xorVal &= -xorVal;

        int[] res = new int[2];

        for (int num : arr) {

            // If bit is not set, it belongs to the first set
            if ((num & xorVal) == 0) {
                res[0] ^= num;
            }

            // If bit is set, it belongs to the second set
            else {
                res[1] ^= num;
            }
        }

        // Ensure the order of the returned numbers is consistent
        if (res[0] > res[1]) {
            int temp = res[0];
            res[0] = res[1];
            res[1] = temp;
        }

        return res;
    }
