#Kth Smallest Number in Multiplication Table
Given three integers m, n and k. Consider a grid of m * n, where mat[i][j] = i * j (1 based index). The task is to return the kth smallest element in the m * n multiplication table.

Examples :

Input: m = 3, n = 3, k = 5
Output: 3
Explanation: 

The 5th smallest element is 3. 
Input: m = 2, n = 3, k = 6
Output: 6 
Explanation: [1, 2, 3][2, 4, 6]. The 6th smallest element is 6.
Constraints:
1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104
1 <= k <= m * n

class Solution {
    public int kthSmallest(int m, int n, int k) {
        int low = 1, high = m * n;
        
        while (low < high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            int count = countLessEqual(mid, m, n);
            
            if (count < k) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid;
            }
        }
        
        return low;
    }

    // Count how many numbers are â‰¤ x in m x n table
    private int countLessEqual(int x, int m, int n) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            count += Math.min(x / i, n);
        }
        return count;
    }
}
